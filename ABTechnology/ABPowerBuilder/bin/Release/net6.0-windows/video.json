{"Notes":"\r\n\tRead- Proverbs 22:19\r\n\t19 Better to live in a desert\r\n    than with a quarrelsome and nagging wife.\r\n    Read- Proverbs 30:20 \r\n    \u201CThis is the way of an adulterous woman:\r\n    She eats and wipes her mouth\r\n    and says, \u2018I\u2019ve done nothing wrong.\u2019\r\n   \r\n    - Read Provebs 5: 1-10\r\n    My son, pay attention to my wisdom,\r\n    turn your ear to my words of insight,\r\n2 that you may maintain discretion\r\n    and your lips may preserve knowledge.\r\n3 For the lips of the adulterous woman drip honey,\r\n    and her speech is smoother than oil;\r\n4 but in the end she is bitter as gall,\r\n    sharp as a double-edged sword.\r\n5 Her feet go down to death;\r\n    her steps lead straight to the grave.\r\n6 She gives no thought to the way of life;\r\n    her paths wander aimlessly, but she does not know it.\r\n\r\n7 Now then, my sons, listen to me;\r\n    do not turn aside from what I say.\r\n8 Keep to a path far from her,\r\n    do not go near the door of her house,\r\n9 lest you lose your honor to others\r\n    and your dignity[a] to one who is cruel,\r\n10 lest strangers feast on your wealth\r\n    and your toil enrich the house of another.\r\n    \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t","Description":"So...
